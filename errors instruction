# Api & Executing problems
// here some common problems i've seen with executors
string text = fastColoredTextBox1.Text <-- here shoud be a ";"
            this.api.SendLuaScript() <-- here shoud be a ";"
            now theres alot of things wrong with this
            first of all there shoud be a ";" at the end
            and the other problem is there shoud be Text in the "this.api.SendLuaScript()"
            here some fixes
            string text = fastColoredTextBox1.Text;
            this.api.SendLuaScript(text);
